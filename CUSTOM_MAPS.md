## Recommended Custom Maps

In general, any map that doesn't have a custom `progs.dat` will be compatible.

A good starting point is to visit <https://www.quaddicted.com/reviews/>, sort by rating, and check if the map you're looking at doesn't have a custom `progs.dat`. There is an icon towards the bottom of each map's page that will tell you. Also, the map should not have any "dependency".

For maps with `.pak`: extracting any `.pak` to the `Id1` folder is the recommended way to install custom maps, but you can also rename the `XX` in `.pakXX` to some unique number which comes before the Quake VR `.pak` files and after the regular Quake ones.

If you try any of the maps below, please let me know if they work and we can list them under "confirmed working".
