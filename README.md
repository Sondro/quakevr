## Disclaimer

* This is a free open-source project done for fun and to contribute to the VR community. **Donations are appreciated**, but making money is not a goal for `quakevr`.
* The project is still in an early stage. Expect bugs and lack of polish. It was fully tested only with a Valve Index headset and controllers.
* **Tweaking the settings in-game is highly recommended before playing.** The default settings might not be ideal for your hardware and body proportions.
* The game heavily relies on modified *QuakeC* files. Therefore, mods or expansion packs are not compatible out of the box, but should be easy to port.
* Feel free to open issues or contact me at <vittorio.romeo@outlook.com> for any issue, feature request, or question about the code.
* Join us on the [**official Discord**](http://discord.me/quakevr) for discussion, feedback, and beta testing. *[(Direct invite link.)](https://discord.gg/wBBcjpn)*

## Installation

1. Install ["Visual C++ x64 Redistributable"](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) package.

2. Install "Quake 1". The [Steam version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310/QUAKE/) works well.

3. Grab the latest binary from [the releases page](https://github.com/SuperV1234/quakevr/releases).

4. Extract the contents of the package directly in the Quake installation folder *(e.g. `C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Quake`)*.

5. Run the game by launching the `.exe` you just extracted.

### Mission Pack 1: Scourge of Armagon

Quake VR supports the "Scourge of Armagon" official mission pack. It can be installed alongside the regular Quake files, enabling you to play either the original game or SoA without having to restart Quake VR.

1. Install "QUAKE Mission Pack 1: Scourge of Armagon". The [Steam version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/9040/QUAKE_Mission_Pack_1_Scourge_of_Armagon/) works well.

2. Go to the installation folder.

3. Open the `hipnotic` folder.

4. Make a copy of `pak0.pak`, and rename it to `pak3.pak`.

5. Copy the newly created `pak2.pak` in your Quake VR installation folder, under `Id1`. Usually, this means simply copying `pak2.pak` to `../Id1`.

6. The contents of your `Id1` folder should now contain:
   * Official Quake files: `pak0.pak` and `pak1.pak`;
   * Scourge of Armagon mission pack files: `pak2.pak`;
   * Quake VR files: `pak10.pak`, `pak11.pak`, `pak12.pak`.

When Scourge of Armagon is installed, it overwrites Quake 1's `start.bsp` with its own starting map. In order to play Quake 1 maps, use the *"Change Map"* functionality under *"Quake VR Settings"*.


### Mission Pack 2: Dissolution of Eternity

Quake VR supports the "Dissolution of Eternity" official mission pack. The instructions above apply here as well. Take `pak0.pak` from the `rogue` folder, rename it to somethhing unique (e.g. `pak4.pak` if you installed Scourge of Armagon), and place it in your `Id1` folder.

### Highly Recommended Addons

The [HD Textures and Soundtrack](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1noIH27xA8gnr_hwqouXiSoMQBIyuf__V/view) addon is highly recommended to improve immersion.

* [Installation Instructions](https://old.reddit.com/r/ValveIndex/comments/fbs1nh/quake_vr_release_trailer_v001/fj7205c/)

### Custom Maps

For supported custom maps, please see [CUSTOM_MAPS.md](https://github.com/SuperV1234/quakevr/blob/master/CUSTOM_MAPS.md).

### Vispatching

The Quake VR engine supports transparent water, however original Quake maps need to be patched in order for it to work properly. It is therefore highly recommended that you "vispatch" your Quake (and Scourge of Armagon) maps.

Follow [this guide](http://fps.maros.pri.ee/index.php?event=1304) to easily "vispatch" your maps. Alternatively, search for the term "vispatching" online, or read the README provided with the [`VisPatch` tool](http://vispatch.sourceforge.net/).

Once your maps are patched, go through the options in the *"Transparency Options"* menu under *"Quake VR Settings"* to enable/tweak transparency levels.

## First Steps

### SteamVR Bindings

The first thing you should do after starting Quake VR is opening the *"Controller Bindings"* interface on SteamVR and ensure that in-game actions are mapped to the motion controllers.

### In-Game Configuration

After setting up your bindings, please go through all the options in *"Quake VR Settings"*, and tweak the game to your liking. Do not forget to:

* Calibrate your height;
* Tweak the position of the *"VR torso"* and of the holsters (*"hotspots"*);
* Go through the *"Immersion Settings*".

There is no "best" way of playing Quake VR. Simply use the settings that you enjoy the most!

## Troubleshooting

* > The game seems to work fine, but there is no audio!

    * Ensure that the correct audio output device is set (HMD) and that the volume is turned up.

    * Open the Desktop view from your Steam VR dashboard, and make sure that the Quake VR window is in focus. You can bring it in focus by clicking on it.

    * Check that the in-game audio settings are correct.

* > How do I obtain the grappling hook?

    * The grappling hook is only available through cheats: it is a very fun *toy* but it would completely break the progression of most levels. To obtain it, go to the "Debug Utilities" sub-menu under the "Quake VR Dev Tools" menu - there will be an option to enable it there. You can then spawn it by using the "Impulse 14 (Spawn All)" command, or cycle to it if you have weapon cycling enabled.
